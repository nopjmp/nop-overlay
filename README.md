# nop-overlay

This overlay is mostly software I've enjoyed using or other people seem to enjoy using. I'm still new to ebuilds so please be patient with me and if you find a better way to do something, submit an issue.

## Basic usage

You **WILL** need to have layman setup before using this overlay.

Since this is an unofficial repository, you'll need to add it using layman:

```
layman -o https://github.com/nopjmp/nop-overlay/raw/master/layman.xml -f -a nop-overlay
```

All software is marked as testing. You'll need to unmask the keywords in your packages.keywords directory/file.

## TODO

Add more memes.
